Looking to get an early start on training? It's not necessary but you can never start getting active too soon! Spartan offers free sprint-level training plans ([link](http://d1gzvc2c13psez.cloudfront.net/sites/6/2015/07/Spartan-Race-Couch-to-Sprint_Plan.pdf) here). 

The plan is rather specific and can be boiled down to this: practice bodyweight movements (i.e. push-ups, pull-ups, bear crawls, burpees, lunges, air-squats, planks, etc.), be able to run comfortably on an off for a total of about 4 miles, and work on grip strength (i.e. farmer carries, hanging from a pull up bar, etc.). The benefits of consistency cannot be overstated! Find what works for you and stick with it. 

If anyone needs a running buddy, Mary is in the early stages of training for a half-marathon and would be happy to share running routs/organize short group runs (contact at mstory@andrew.cmu.edu)!

Some of you have showed interest in joining the MSE department spartan race team! To register, go to this [link](https://www.spartan.com/en/race/detail/3280/overview?filter=sprint)

Click on the red button that says "Register Now" for the Sunday Afternoon time slot; this should be the least expensive option. It should be noted that the longer you wait to register, the more expensive registration will be (there are three price brackets).

As you go through the registration process, at some point it will ask if you would like to join a team. Select "join existing team" and enter the following information to join the CMU MSE team:

- Team Name: Heavy Metal
- Password: materials

One final bit of information regarding registration: select 1215pm - 100pm for the preferred afternoon start time (the first of 3 options).

Occasionally around certain holidays, spartan will offer discounts ranging between 10-25% off races. This group will be notified when any discounts become available.

Feel free to contact me (Mary) with questions/comments/concerns/etc. about the race!

Best Regards,

--GSAC + Mary
