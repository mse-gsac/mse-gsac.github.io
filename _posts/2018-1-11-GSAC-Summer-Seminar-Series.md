Welcome to the GSAC Summer Seminar Series 2018 page! Due to overwhelmingly positive feedback from last year, the series will be held again this summer!

GSAC Summer Seminar Series is intended to give invited MSE faculty an opportunity to speak about their experiences and enlighten us in topics that interest them. 

Last summer, presentations covered a broad range of topics, including "Countermeasures for Counterfeit Money" and "The Mechanics of Publishing Your Work".

The topics for this year are TBD; if anyone has any suggestions for topics feel free to contact any GSAC rep.
