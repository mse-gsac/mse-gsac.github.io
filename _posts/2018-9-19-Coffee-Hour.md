Hi grads! GSAC is putting on a coffee break for all grad students (but especially the first years in the thick of the minis right now) this Thursday, Sept. 20, 2018. Come enjoy coffee and cookies from Au Bon Pain and commiserate with your fellow students!

With love (and free coffee and cookies),
Your friendly GSAC board :)
