### MSE-GSAC

Graduate Student Advisory Committee (GSAC) is the organization for graduate students in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department. We plan social events that include both students and faculty members in order to foster relationships outside class and the lab. Specifically for students, we plan events tailored to helping graduate students prepare for the various milestones involved in the PhD program, from the RPE, PhD overview, to preparing for conferences. GSAC is also the interface between the Graduate Student Assembly and the MSE department. In this regard, we ensure that our interests are voiced in the general GSA meetings, and help ensure the quality of graduate student life.
